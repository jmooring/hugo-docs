## Introduction

<!--
directory structure
content types
page bundles
sections
organization

-----------------

These are so tightly related that it doesn't make sense to have separate pages:

- <https://gohugo.io/content-management/organization/>
- <https://gohugo.io/content-management/types/>
- <https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/>
- <https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-resources/>

Also incorporate intent from:

- <https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs/issues/2428>
- <https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs/issues/2476>
- <https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs/issues/1164>
- <https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs/issues/1487>
- <https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs/issues/1578>
- <https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs/pull/1548>
- <https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs/issues/1599>
- <https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs/issues/1200#issuecomment-1799288532>, specifically items 2, 3, 4, and 5
