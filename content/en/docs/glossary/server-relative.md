  A _server-relative_ path is the final path from the web server's root, used in the generated site. These paths always begin with a leading slash and account for the [`baseURL`][] and [_dimension_](g) prefixes such as [_language_](g), [_role_](g), or [_version_](g). For example, `/en/examples/old-name/` is a server-relative path.

  See also: [_page-relative_](g), [_site-relative_](g).
