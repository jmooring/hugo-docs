## showcase

Some of the showcases are still relevant, so at some point we might want to
give a few of them a fresh coat of paint... assuming the corresponding site is
still built with Hugo.

## tools

The tools section has been a link dump for a long time, and some of these tools
haven't been updated in years. If users want to browse related stuff:

- https://github.com/topics/hugo (9392)
- https://github.com/topics/hugo-mod (45)
- https://github.com/topics/hugo-module (119)
- https://github.com/topics/hugo-modules (11)
- https://github.com/topics/hugo-partial (1)
- https://github.com/topics/hugo-partials (3)
- https://github.com/topics/hugo-shortcode (13)
- https://github.com/topics/hugo-shortcodes (41)
- https://github.com/topics/hugo-theme (1641)
- https://github.com/topics/hugo-themes (27)
- https://github.com/topics/hugo-utility (3)

There's obviously some overlap in the tag soup above.

If there are a handful of tools that we think are really, really important,
let's create one page at reference/miscellaneous/tools.
